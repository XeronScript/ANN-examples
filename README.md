# Artificial Neural Networks in Python
This remote repository contains various types of artificial neural networks (ANNs) written in Python and one Genetic Algorithm (GA). ANNs are a type of machine learning model that is loosely based on the structure of the human brain. They are used for a wide range of tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive modeling. GAs, on the other hand, are mostly used in optimization, e.g. finding largest or smallest values of given mathematical functions.

The purpose of this repository is to show some examples of ANNs that I was creating for my University subject.

## Content:
- Single Perceptron
- Single-layer Neural Network
- FFWD (Feed Forward)
- Genetic Algorithm (GA)

All scripts were written without using popular Python libraries such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc. Except FFWD, which is using `neurolab` library to show performance differences of different algorithms.

## Usage
To check any of the ANNs or GA, clone this repository using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/XeronScript/ANN-examples
```

Once you have cloned the repository, you can navigate to the directory containing the ANN you want to use and run the Python script. Make sure you have installed all the required libraries before running the script.
